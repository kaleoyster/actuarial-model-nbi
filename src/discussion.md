- In reviewing the actuarial tables, the correlation matrices, the visualization and the comments from bridge stakeholders has lead to multiple insights. 

- ** Very similar to  baseline difference score, we can develop the idea of actuarial tables as the same.**

- First, it is clear that all states 
- Second, one of the anticipated results was the nearby states would show similar repair patterns. and physically distant but geographically similar states would show similar repair patterns.
- Demographic factors had a what seemed a surprising influence on repair patterns or vice versa. For example, some factors did not seem to infleunce repair probabilities as much as expected included precipirtation.

    Conclusion
</h3>

In conclusion, the actuarial life table approach provides a meaningful view into bridge repair probabilites with the use of bridge intervention matrix. Our analysis is based on several study windows that take into account bridge time-lines from 1992 to 2021. 

- When visualized at the national level, it clearly shows that many states behave markedly different.
- Bridge stakeholders could use this data and corresponding visualization to draw conclusions about the individual states, compare regions, postulate about the latent variables, and suggest data that could be collected to further analysis.

- In terms of future work, this actuarial approach could be extended to all three major bridge components in the NBI data.

- More generally, the non-parametric nature of this work could make it straightforward to extend to other infrastructure fields. The underlying model does not assume that it is modeling a bridge. As a result, this approach could allow for effective domain transfer.
