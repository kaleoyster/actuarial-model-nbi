Bridges are critical infrastructure whose maintenance is a key responsibility for both government and private organizations. Costly to build and repair, bridges are valuable assets that can benefit from improved predictive maintenance. In this work, we present a novel, straightforward, non-parametric method for doing so based on actuarial life tables.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The objective of this research study is to develop a measure / method for computing bridge maintenance frequency.

### ðŸ’ª Challenge

In the NBI dataset, it is a **challenge** to identify maintenance patterns. Because, the use of `reconstruction_year` within the NBI inspection records does not provide an valuable information about the type of repair or reconstruction done.

### ðŸ§ª Solution

 To address this challenge we can use bridge intervention matrix, that utilizes the bridge intervention matrix for `deck` to identify various types of intervention depending on the probability of the transition.
