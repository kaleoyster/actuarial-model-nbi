- Bridges are critical infrastructure whose maintenance is a key responsibility for both government and private organizations. 

- Costly to build and repair, bridges are valuable assets that can benefit from improved predictive maintenance.
 
 - In this work, we present a novel, straightforward, non-parametric method for doing so based on actuarial life tables.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- The objective of this research study is to develop a measure / method for computing bridge maintenance frequency.

### ðŸ’ª Challenge
- In the NBI dataset, it is a **challenge** to identify maintainance patterns. Because, the use of `reconstruction_year` does not provide an valuable information about the type of repair or reconstruction done.

### ðŸ§ª Solution
- To address this challenge we can use bridge intervention matrix, that utilizes the bridge intervention matrix for `deck` to identify various types of intervention depending on the probability of the transition.
